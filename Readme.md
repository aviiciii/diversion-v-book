### Features
- No need to carry a whole bundle of books 
- Easy workflow management
- Work is never lost, every data is secure 
- 
### Its Principle
A simple concept is when we learn something by writing (or by taking notes) it takes a
lot of time and do not lasts long so when we came back to revise we get a lot of doubt
(because while taking notes, we can't write everything that the lecturer or the faculty
says) 



### Extra Features (that will make this project more successful)

#### First of all,Itâ€™s an all in one platform both for teachers and students

1.features for students
- Students can add the short clips of the topics in the class notes that they need to revise again
- Students can make voice notes ,so that by listening they can get the concept easily.


2.features for teachers
- They do not need to create ppts or learning materials,it will be provided by V Book Web app itself.

### Technologies Used
- Front-end - HTML, CSS, Js, ReactJs
- Framework-Mern stack
- Database - Mongo DB
- Cloud - AWS

### github information 

Clone With main branch for latest code.

For running Frontend:-

step-1: cd frontend
step-2: npm i/npm i --legacy-peer-deps
step-3: npm start

Notes:- 

1.Try to use latest technlogies and with proper syntax...eg. img must have alt tag
2.API call should be like production level...
    I. dispatch function from components to action
    II. then call function from action to api function and dispatch data to universal state 
     management reudx/reduxTolkit
    III. Any api call should not be inside any component box there are already too much 
     code in every components and our codebase is very large so it will be difficult to debug anything or track functionality.
     IV. Console and Terminal should be free totaly so try to remove non-usable filed which create log in console and warning in terminal.

N.B.: Overall, code like production level will ease our work.
